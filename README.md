# Here are the major projects that I have completed!

- Axis & Allies Buy Calculator Test Results.pdf: Document of the results of a test I did on the optimal purchases in the game. Includes steps to follow so you don't have to run the program, instead just doing some basic math that I realized you could do after running the test.

- Axis & Allies Buy Calculator.py: The actual program, in Python, that calculates the optimal purchase given the amount of money and industrial capacity you have. It works for any Axis & Allies edition where tanks cost 5, artillery 4, and infantry 3.

- ChaucerMaker.py: This is the program I wrote using open sourced code from Aladdin Persson that would format the glossed translations of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in a way that my machine translator could read. Persson's code: https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/master/ML/Pytorch/more_advanced/torchtext/torchtext_tutorial3.py.

- Ben Lambright Project Code For Introduction to Epidemiology with Statistical Programming.R: The file, in R, includes the code I used to find a correlation between happiness and education for the Introduction to Epidemiology with Statistical Programming course I took.

- Final Junior Project Presentation.pptx: The final presentation for my Junior Project, may help to explain what my project is and how it works.

- Final Project Code For Clinical Natural Language Processing.R: The code, in R, for my final project in my Clinical Natural Language Processing course, where I searched doctors' notes for patients' complications from diabetes.

- Junior Project.py: This is the code, in Python, for my Junior Project, where I searched for the best words for speech language pathologists to use for their speech therapy sessions with lower elementary students with speech disorders. 

- My Clinical Natural Language Processing Project (1).pptx: This is the powerpoint that explains the approach and performance of my code for my Clinical Natural Language Processing course.

- processing.py, base.css, and flask_app.py are the code for my website: http://benl2020.pythonanywhere.com/. This is a website version of my junior project, so it searches for words for speech therapy based on the user's selections. The HTML code for the website is imbeded within flask_app.py. Note: the website is currently down due to the monthly cost of pythonanywhere.
